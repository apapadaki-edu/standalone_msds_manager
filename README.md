### Files and order of execution

<br><br>

**doc** folder contains some documentation files.

**This project is currently in the process of being rebuilt. For this version, the files in "current_version_py_db_files" folder, must be moved up one level, before running the executable python files. The order of execution is indicated on the diagram above. In the future, during the application's containerization (using Docker), volumes will be built from sql scripts located inside the sql_scripts folder, as such, those python files will no longer be necessary.**

I would be extremely grateful for any feedback or tips on how to improve or change this project. It would help immensely my development as a programmer.
