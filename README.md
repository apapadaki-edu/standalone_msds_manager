**doc** folder contains some documentation files and an er diagram that explains the database's architecture.

<br><br>
**_!IMPORTANT_ for the current version please move the files in "current_version_py_db_files" folder, up one level and then run the executable python files as per the diagram above. At the time of containerization those files will not be needed, since there will be built volumns from sql scripts in sql_scripts folder.**
